Hi Engineers!

Today is the tree planting day in China. Although we cut down a lot of trees in the game, please be eco-friendly in reality ;).

We heard your voice of the quick copy of the Sorters, Blueprints, etc. Don't worry, they are on their way - as big fans of factory games, we understand your needs!

[Version 0.6.17.5932]

Features:



The Mass Upgrade / Dismantle function is now available! You are now able to define the scope of batch upgrades/demolitions in the same way as laying foundations. Please notice the red mark in the screenshot above.
LOD1 and LOD2 are added to the rendering to optimize the GPU Rendering cost of the Smelter.


Changes:

Remade the model, texture, and VFX of Thermal Power Station, and the interface position for Sorter is fine-tuned.
Remade the model, texture, and VFX of Mini Fusion Power Station, and the interface position for Sorter is fine-tuned.


Bugfix:

Fixed the bug that the stored liquid may be mixed when the liquid stored in the vertical direction with different kinds of liquid in each Storage Tank.
Thank you for your continuing support! You can send your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
