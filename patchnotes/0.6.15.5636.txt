Hey Engineers!

It's already 3 days since Dyson Sphere Program launch its Early Access, and a brand new week is coming! Thank you for all of your support!

and - don't forget to strike a proper balance between Dyson sphere engineering and rest yourself!

[Version 0.6.15.5636]

New features:

Icarus is glowing for you! Now it can shine your way at night.
Changes:

The 'Logistics Station' is called 'Planetary Logistic Station' now, in order not to mistaken it with the 'Interstellar Logistics Station'.
The maximum range of the foundation cursor is increased to 10x10.
Now the storage tank panel has a different color on its switch button when it is off.
Balance:

The recipe of manufacturing a logistics station is modified - you can save some cost from it!
The recipe of manufacturing a EM-Rail Ejector is modified - you can save some cost from it!
Bugfix:

Fixed a bug that the game window may not display correctly under some resolutions on certain types of monitors.
Fixed a bug that the hotkey may still active while renaming/inserting English text for buildings.
You may meet an error when you were planning a long-long conveyor under construction mode. Now the error won't come out again.
The logistics vessel can't be placed on orbit collectors now.
Now the item count will be shown correctly when you add items to the energy exchanger manually.
We are always here reading your feedback in ( Discord and Google Form)! See you next time!
