Hey engineers!

How is everything going? A reminder before today's update note: It's ok for you to sneak off for a travel, but a long-distance travel without enough fuel and warp flight may not be a good idea. (The exhausted Icarus will float in the universe for a while to recover its power.) Anyway, out team will look into the early stage travel and see what we can do for it.

[Version 0.6.15.5642]

UI:

Now the local time in real life is displayed in Dyson Sphere Program - Don't be confused by the 'CentreBrain'!
Function:

Now you can switch on/off the glow on Icarus at night.
Bug Fix:

Now the '0 mineral' icon will no longer show in the map.
Fixed the bug that the number count of items collected may not be displayed correctly.
Looking forward to your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
