We wonder that if our dear engineers still stay up late after the CentreBrain have release the clock from real life yesterday. Engineers, remember to take care of yourselves, improve their immunity and eat good, rest good.

A Prompt: if you can't launch the game with a "not responding" error under Windows 10 system, we suggest to check Window Update to get the latest Windows 10 version. It is known that Windows 10 1709 version may not be able to run Unity engine games.

[Version 0.6.15.5651]

Feature:

The advisor is bringing 2 new guidelines for you.
Add a readable XML file for game option saving. This file can solve the game crash caused by an error on initial game options while launch the game.
Add a path override file which can be used to solve the problem that some players are not able to launch the game due to the system disk directory.

(If you can't start the game, try the following steps: Find [Game installation path / config/ path.txt ], fill in 'archive' in [path.txt], save and exit it. and then start the game again.)
Change:

Some texture and map have been modified in order to adapt to certain resolutions
Balance:

The probability of Deuterium fractionation has been increased from 0.5% to 1% (only apply to the new facilities build after this patch)
Increase the generating capacity of Dyson swarm from 30kW/solar sail to 36kW/solar sail
Looking forward to your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
