Hi Engineers!

Here comes our first update in March. And, an important functional update is also coming soon!

[Version 0.6.17.5827]

Feature:

From now on, the savedata will also save its creator's ID. The players will be able to see the savedata creator's ID in the right upper corner of the game.
Improved some UI interactive SFX.
Changes:

Data reduction of Dyson shell. The length of archive data generated by Dyson shell is reduced by 50% ~ 60%, and the save/load time is reduced by 20% ~ 30%.
Data reduction of Sorters and Assemblers.
The research materials won't be returned immediately after the research list is suspended. This change is made to avoid the loss of items caused by the logic of "No item will be returned for fractions of a count".
The scene at the end of the prologue is improved.
Now you can storage/pick fluid items manually and check the information of fluid items.
Optimized the description of some items and technologies.
Bugfix:

Fixed the bug that huge amounts of Mini-suns and Storages may made your planet flickering too much.
Fixed the bug that the first frame of the game is incorrect by modifing the loading process.
Fixed the bug that sometimes the mecha may fell into the land after skipped the prologue.
Fixed the bug in calculating the quantity of items when held Ctrl to operate items in Fractionator.
Thank you for your continuing support! You can send your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
