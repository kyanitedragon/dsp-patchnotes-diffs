Hi engineers,

Before the 4th update log in this week, I would like to introduce the MINIMUM requirement of being visible (the threshold to see yourself appear) on Milky Way:

One solar sail or Dyson Sphere node is launched
The savedata's version is 0.7.18 or above;
NO CHEATING (Using third-party software to modify the game data will be judge as cheating)
[Version 0.7.18.6940]

Changes:

Optimized the network interface and data access of the Milky Way
Bugfix:

Fixed the bug that the Logistic Station could't be clicked in Planet View mode
Fixed the bug on judgement of cheating on Milky Way
Thank you for your continuing support! You can send your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
