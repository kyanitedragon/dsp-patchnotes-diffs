Hi Engineers!

CentreBrain is ready for the bug fixes!

[Version 0.6.17.5831]

Fixed the bug that the facility' power consumption was not upgraded after a 'quick upgrading'.
Fixed the bug that the facility' animation was not upgraded after a 'quick upgrading'.
Added a function of 'Savedata Modification' log. You will be able to look up how your savedata was adjusted after the game updates. We added it In order to prevent the similar situation in the future and reduce some impact of facility data adjustment.
Thank you for your continuing support! You can send your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
