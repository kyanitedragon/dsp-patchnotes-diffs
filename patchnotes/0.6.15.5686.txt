An Important Fix: When planets or planetary system is loading, the autosave will be automatically delayed until dynamic loading is finished. It can prevent thread conflicts.
Icarus is now glowing with optimized color and brightness at night.
The minimum UI layout reference height has been changed to 900.

Looking forward to your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
