Hi engineers,

Have you “put on” new “clothes” for the Sun today? We’re excited to announce that Dyson Sphere Program has ranked first place in Steam’s weekly global Top Sellers! This achievement is made possible by you and we will keep moving on with your love and support!

IMPORTANT FIX: Autosaves will be automatically delayed until dynamic loading of planets and planetary systems is complete to prevent thread conflicts.
Icarus now glows with enhanced color and brightness at night.
The minimum UI layout reference height has been changed to 900.
Some English technology descriptions have been reworked.
Thank you for your continuing support! Looking forward to your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
