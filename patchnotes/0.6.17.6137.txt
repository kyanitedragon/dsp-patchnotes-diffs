Hi engineers,

CentreBrain can't dismiss the problems that occur on your way to power it, so we fixed them!

The development of new content will be a long journey full of inspiration. We are also looking forward to the future of the Dyson Sphere Program universe just as you, dear engineers.

Let's take a look at today's update:

[Version 0.6.17.6137]

Features:

Added the query (double-check box) before dismantling the Storage/Tanks/Logistic Stations. You can turn the pop-up box on/off in the Setting.
Added a function that now you can press and hold [SHIFT]+[DELETE] to delete the holding items directly.
Changes:

Power Statistics Panel UI: exchanged the colors of Discharging power and Charging power
Bugfix:

Fixed the bug that sometimes you may received an empty Accumulator after removing a fully charged Accumulator
Fixed the bug that sometimes solar sail was not generated after removing the Dyson sphere frame and Dyson shell
Fixed the bug that the heat value in the Thermal power station did not change after the heat value of fuel was changed
Thank you for your continuing support! You can send your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
