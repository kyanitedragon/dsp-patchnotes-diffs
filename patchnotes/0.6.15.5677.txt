Hi engineers,

Nice weekend! Good rest for both you and usÔºÅ

[Version 0.6.15.5677]

Features:

Now you can hear the demolition of building.
Now you can hear the working sound of 6 kinds of facilities, such as Ray Receiver and Fractionator.
Changes:

You can find a brand new pick-up collision frame for Satellite Substation and Particle Collider. It's easier to distinguish the range of mouse picking now.
Bugfix:

Fixed the bug that the ambient volume did not change with the main volume.
Fixed the bug that sometimes the power UI may display incorrectly when the thermal power station was working under a low workload.
Fixed the bug that the color of the switch button for the storage tank was incorrect.
Modified the collision size of the Tesla tower to solve the problem that sometimes the conveyor belt was not able to connect to it correctly.
Looking forward to your feedback in Discord and Google Form! See you next time!
