Hi engineers,

We know we said yesterday would be the last update, but... here we go again!! We simply can't help it when we discover something to improve, we do it to bring you better gameplay experience. Many of your suggestions have been incorporated into our plan. We intend to work rigorously to optimize and make adjustments to them one after another until we are satisfied. Of course, it still takes a lot of time before we can launch new functions and content. Let's keep looking forward to it together!

This is definitely the last update before the holidays!

Happy 2021!

[Version 0.6.16.5775]

Change:

Canceled the restriction on keybinding of zoom in/out camera.

Now the mouse picking detection will ignore the sorter in construction mode.
Now it will automatically optimize the conflict when View Rotate button and Move to Target button are the same.
